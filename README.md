Millwright
##########

Millwright is an issue tracking system being developed to allow a user to focus on the tasks instead of the process.

The need arose when I was trying to find an issue tracking system for something *other* than software development. Everything was so geared towards tracking issues through commit logs and such that it didn't make much sense when used in any other context. Millwright is so simple that it works for just about anything. The simplicity also makes it easy enough to modify for whatever your needs are.
